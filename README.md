 <h2> Prerequisites </h2>
  <p>To follow along with this repo, you will need to have the following installed on your machine:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Node.js</li>
   <li>npm</li>
  </ul>
<p>You also need to have a basic understanding of React JS and Tailwind CSS.</p>
<h2> Getting Started </h2>
<p>To get started, we will create a new React application using vite. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:</p>

```
npm create vite@latest
```
<p>You will be prompted to enter the name of your project. Enter the name of your project and press enter. In this repo, we will be naming our project Capital shop. You will also be prompted to select a framework. Select React and press enter. You will also be prompted to select a variant. Select Javascript and press enter. This will create a new React application in a folder named Capital shop. To start the application, navigate to the react-cart folder cd capital shop and run the following command in your terminal:</p>

```
npm run dev
```

<p>This will start the application in development mode. You can now open the application in your browser by navigating to <span style = "background-color: red"> http://localhost:5173. </span></p>

<h2>Installing Tailwind CSS</h2>
<p>To install Tailwind CSS, run the following command in your terminal:</p>

```
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```
```
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

<p>This will create a tailwind.config.js file in the root of your project. Open the tailwind.config.js file and add the following code to it:</p>

```
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```
<p>Next, let's clean up the index.css file in the src folder. Open the index.css file and remove all the code in it. Next, add the following code to the index.css file:</p>

```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
